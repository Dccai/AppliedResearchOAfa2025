Old Ye Prompt

This is a website that takes in text prompts and generates an image where the 
prompts are put in context of knighthood. For example, when you put in the prompt "I play videogames", an image of a knight playing with a controller appears. This is the dream website for anyone who has always dreamed of being a knight.

In order to run it, you need to download flask and the hugging face api. You will also need to download Pillow to process the image data from the AI model.

If the token doesn't work for you, you might need to get your own token from hugging face. In that case, get your token and replace the HF_TOKEN in .env with your token.
